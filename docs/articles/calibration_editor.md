# Calibration Editor

The following have been added to the “C13440 Calibration” window:

- **Setting Accessibility**: All of the camera settings are now accessible to the user.
- **Automated ROI Acceptance**: Users are no longer required to click a "Draw ROIs" or "Accept ROIs" button. When in "Auto Crop" mode, the defined ROIs will automatically be updated and accepted whenever a new ROI is drawn, an ROI is deleted, an ROI is moved, or an ROI is resized.
- **Resize ROI**: ROIs can now be resized by right-clicking and dragging an existing ROI.
- **Lookup Table Generator**: Users can not generate, load, and save one dimensional lookup tables.
- **Image Preview**: When changing the crop of the image, the previously cropped image is stored to provide a preview when adjusting crops. This should make cropping to features easier.
